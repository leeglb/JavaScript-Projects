                    <h1>What is a calorie? Why is it important to us?</h1>
                    <p>A <strong>calorie</strong> is a unit of energy which we use to measure the amount of energy that food provides to us.
                    Often times, many people confuse calories and kilojoules. Whilst both are units of measurement for energy, they provide different values.
                    Considering the average person, there are 2000 calories for women or 2500 calories for men. This would then be represented as 8368 kilojoules for women,
                    and 10460 kilojoules for men. Keep that in mind next time when you check the nutritional label of food. They are normally always labelled as
                    kilojoules and not calories, thats why its important you track or convert it before consuming.
                    The reason why we need to know calories is due to the law of thermodynamics. To lose weight / be in a caloric deficit, we need to burn more energy
                    then we eat so that our bodies can use the extra stored energy as fuel (our fat). To gain weight / be in a caloric surplus, we need to consume more energy 
                    than we burn, so that our bodie will store more of it as fat. This is the main concept that needs to be recognised when dieting / bulking.</p>

                    <p>Many new individuals who try to lose weight aim for certain diets which are often misleading and provide no additional benenfit. Often times
                    these diets may even lead to further weight increases, demotivating the individual and ultimately leading to them giving up.</p>
