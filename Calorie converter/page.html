                    <h1>What is a calorie? Why is it important to us?</h1>
                    <p>A <strong>calorie</strong> is a unit of energy which we use to measure the amount of energy that food provides to us.
                    Often times, many people confuse calories and kilojoules. Whilst both are units of measurement for energy, they provide different values.
                    Considering the average person, there are 2000 calories for women or 2500 calories for men. This would then be represented as 8368 kilojoules for women,
                    and 10460 kilojoules for men. <br><br>
                    Keep that in mind next time when you check the nutritional label of food. They are normally always labelled as
                    kilojoules and not calories, thats why its important you track or convert it before consuming.
                    The reason why we need to know what calories are is due to the law of thermodynamics. <br><br>
                    To lose weight / be in a caloric deficit, we need to burn more energy
                    then we eat so that our bodies can use the extra stored energy as fuel (our fat). To gain weight / be in a caloric surplus, we need to consume more energy 
                    than we burn, so that our bodie will store more of it as fat. This is the main concept that needs to be recognised when dieting / bulking.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div id="trackingcalories">
                    <h1>Why is it important we track calories?</h1>
                    <p>Whilst many people believe that by consuming less food, we will lose weight, this is ultimately the opposite. We need to eat less <strong>junk food</strong>
                    and eat less calorie dense foods. The reason why many people eat so much junk food but feel hungry is because these foods do not contain much fibre, protein
                    or any of the essential nutrients we need. Instead they are mainly carb focused and because of the processed oils and sugars, this only increases our brains
                    need to consume more of these junky foods. Now, before all your hopes and dreams of junk food is crushed, you can still eat it on a caloric deficit, because 
                    your body will be burning more calories than your maintenance regardless but I suggest against it. Instead, try eating low sugar / sugar free substitutes or
                    creating protein / healthy alternatives. Remember, your diet is not all just salad and eggs. Have some dessert oats, frozen berries and yoghurt, etc. Tracking 
                    is something I would consider essential for the first couple years of dieting. <br><br>
                    Tracking your calories, protein intake, etc are crucial steps to prevent over / 
                    under-eating and ensuring that you can slowly create a mindset for the future to not rely on tracking but on portion sizes and micronutrients. To begin tracking,
                    find your maintenance calories, subtract between 200-500 calories from your maintenance calories depending on how fast you want to lose the weight. Remember, the
                    faster, the less energy you will have, decreased mental clarity and motivation. <strong>Do this at your own risk.</strong><br><br>
                    For more a sustainable approach, stick to 200-300 and 
                    always eat 2-3 grams per kg of bodyweight in protein to keep yourself satiated and to prevent muscle loss whilst losing fat. Include weight training and low 
                    intensity cardio (10k - 15k steps a day). Remember, it will take time. Take it easy, eat more clean and whole foods and reward yourself with a day or two off 
                    once you have seen good progress to give your mind and body a break. Its a long process, but it is all the whilst worth it. </p>

                    <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
                    <p>Remember, make dieting fun and enjoy your meals. Look forward to waking up and eating nutritious food and feeling good. Some personal advice I would give
                        is that try be creative and include more fruits (especially berries) with low fat yoghurts. Include protein bars, however do not be too reliant as they 
                        are still quite proccessed. <br><br>
                        Avoid drinking your calories, always try eating it so you feel more full. Drink lots of water & replace any sodas/beverages with no sugar alternatives (same with sauces).<br><br>
                        If you are more on the cheaper side & do not mind eating less "appealing" food, try my method of tuna, low fat mince, frozen veges and diced tomatoes. Cheap, but disgusting looking :)
                        <br><br>
                        As said before, every so often have a cheat day. Dont go too overboad, but remember that sometimes even with a cheat day, you can still lose weight for the week if your calories are under.<br><br>
                        Some days / weeks, your scale may not go down but just wait. Please do not give up. Sometimes it will fluctuate, but you will lose weight no matter what on a calorie deficit.<br><br>
                        <strong>ALSO REMEMBER, CUT OUT OIL SINCE THE CALORIES ARE SO HIGH AND MEASURE ANY SAUCES / SPECIAL SEASONINGS CAUSE THEY HAVE CALORIES!!!</strong>

        <h1 class="calorietitle" id="secondtitle">What To Eat</h1>

        <div id="whattoeat">
            <p><strong>What should we eat then?</strong> For a caloric deficit setting, it is best to priotise
            clean, whole foods as these contain less calories for more volume that you can consume. Here is an example of 
            what is considered whole and clean.</p>
            <div id="outerfooddiv">
                <div id="innerfooddiv">
                    <img src="protein.jpg">
                    <h3>Meat</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">Most importantly, is our protein sources. When you are on a caloric deficit, you need to feel full and also ensure that your body has enough protein to keep your muscles even whilst losing fat.</p>
                    <p>On average, during a deficit, we aim for 2-3 grams of protein per kg. So for a 60kg individual, we would recommend 120-180kg of protein (of course it is dependent on exercise and goals).</p>
                    <p>The health benefits of meat / eggs / fish are obvious and we have always consumed such food. Even during times of high processed ingredients and chemicals, it is best we stick to natural, high protein sources.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="innerfooddiv">
                    <img src="fruit.jpg">
                    <h3>Fruit</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">A personal favourite of mine. Fruit is filled with antioxidants, fibre and is a great way to help with sweet cravings. Not only is there hundreds of benefits with consumption of fruit, it is a great snack. </p>
                    <p>Pair fruits with oats, yoghurt, smoothies, etc. The combinations are endless. Whilst all fruits are good, there are some which are higher in calories and I would generally avoid. During a deficit it is recommended for berries.</p>
                    <p>These range from strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, etc. In addition, more "water" containing fruits are better such as cherry tomatoes, watermelon, etc. </p>
                    <p></p>
                </div>
                <div id="innerfooddiv">
                    <img src="leafy greens.jpg">
                    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">Vegetables are another essential food that we need for fibre and to help "eat more food for less calories". Vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, leafy greens are your best choice. Including onions, cucumber and other alternatives are all great choices.</p>
                    <p>Whilst they may not fill you up for the longest, they help you with consuming more food whilst not wasting too many calories. Additionally, they do provide health benefits and essential nutrients for our body, so vegetables are a must regardless of dieting or not.</p>
                    <p><i>A tip for veges, pair them with your protein sources and consume lots alongside drinking lots of water, to keep yourself more full.</i></p>

                    <img src="classic-oatmeal.jpg">
                    <h3>Oatmeal</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">An absolute classic, oatmeal is a great source of fibre and a nice source of carbohydrates before the gym. These are a great superfood for different dessert creations. From overnight oats to warm oatmeal on winter days, it truly does suit every occasion.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the oatmeal and how aggressive your deficit is, I would suggest to not consume too much of it and definitely do not rely on it. </p>
                    <p>Some awesome recommendations is sugar free maple syrup & frozen berries for an amazing texture. Or even drizzles of melted chocolate / biscoff would be beneficial for sweet cravings. (Remember to weigh the sauces).</p>

                    <h3>Protein Yoghurts</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">Now, unfortunately for the next few products, we are going into slightly more processed territory, however we are all human and we can't be perfect 100% of the time and these alternative are good for on the fly / at work. Most importantly, they are cost effective.</p>
                    <p>Protein yoghurt is a great choice for getting your protein in with an amazing calorie ratio. Most brands have 14-15 grams of protein for 90-100 calories. For these macros, we cannot ignore such an amazing product. However, future wise, I would suggest switching to natural alternatives.</p>

                    <img src="protein bars.jpg">
                    <h3>Protein Bars</h3>
                    <p class="subtext">Same as before, whilst these are quite processed, if you are on the go or need to get in some protein with little calories remaining. Protein bars are a good option. With many companies, there are quite nice flavours which can replicate certain foods which you may crave.</p>
                    <p>It is a good product in the way that, if it tastes like the higher calorie junk you crave, consuming these may help and overall prevent you from binge eating. Whilst some protein bars have quite an artifical taste, for the macros it is quite an important product for anyones weight loss journey.</p>

                    <img src="no sugar.jpg">
                    <h3>Sugar Free Sodas </h3>
                    <p class="subtext">Sugar free sodas are a great alternative and a way to preserve calories when in a deficit. By utilising no sugar alternatives, you can essentially have delicious drinks with no guilt. Only downsides are the health implications with over consumption of such drinks. However this 
                        is same for sugar filled drinks. 
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, a 500ml bottle of coke may contain 200+ calories in comparison to no sugar version with 0 calories. Now you have 200 extra calories which can be used for food.</p>
                    <p>Remember, we want as little of liquid calories as possible, so that we are more full and can sustain ourselves for longer.</p>

        <h1 class="calorietitle" id="thirdtitle">How Should You Train?</h1>
        <div id="training">
            <div id="cardio">
                <h1>Cardio</h1>
                <p>Whilst many believe that intense cardio is the key to fat loss, it is often an inefficient strategy for those aiming to maintain energy levels while sustaining a calorie deficit. 
                    Cardio undeniably burns a significant amount of calories, improves cardiovascular health, and increases endurance, but it also depletes energy stores rapidly. 
                    This can lead to excessive fatigue, increased hunger, and a higher likelihood of overeating to compensate for the energy loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before you think cardio should be avoided entirely, it still has its place. However, for those prioritizing fat loss while maintaining sustainable energy levels, walking is a superior alternative. 
                    Walking burns a consistent amount of calories without inducing the same level of fatigue as high-intensity cardio, allowing you to stay active throughout the day without compromising recovery.
                </p>
                <img>
                <p>
                    For optimal fat loss, aim for 10k-15k steps per day while maintaining a slight caloric deficit of 200-500 calories. This method allows you to remain energized, improve cardiovascular health, and prevent the excessive hunger spikes often caused by high-intensity workouts. 
                    Balance this with weight training, adequate protein intake (2-3g per kg of body weight), and whole, nutrient-dense foods. It's a slow process, but sustainability is key. Progress will come with consistency and patience. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="weightlifting">
                <h1>Weights</h1>
                <p>Weight training is a far more effective long-term approach to improving body composition and increasing overall energy expenditure. Strength training builds muscle, and the more muscle you have, the more calories your body burns at rest. 
                    This means that even when you're not training, your metabolism remains elevated, making it easier to stay lean without excessive reliance on cardio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, before you think cardio has no place, it still plays an important role in cardiovascular health and endurance. However, weightlifting offers long-term benefits that go beyond just burning calories during a session. 
                    Unlike cardio, which only burns calories in the moment, muscle built from weight training continues to increase your energy expenditure throughout the day.  
                </p>
                <img>

                <p>For weight training to be truly effective, intensity is key. You should train with 1 or no reps in reserve (RIR), meaning each set is pushed close to failure. This ensures maximum muscle fiber recruitment, leading to better strength gains and long-term metabolic benefits. 
                    Combining weight training with daily movement, such as walking, ensures your body remains active without excessive fatigue. 
                    It's a slow process, but the results are worth it. More muscle, higher calorie burn, and a stronger, healthier body.

            <h2>Some links for weightlifting plans/structures:</h2>
            <p>For the overall plan, the most effective approach is to go for a 2-3 set range with 6-8 reps. This ensure thats you can 
                optimally push yourself to fatigue (leaving 1 rep in reserve or none, i.e. meaning you push yourself until you cannot do another).
                For such weight training, there is <strong>progressive overload</strong> in which every week, the weight or amount of reps you can 
                do increase. This is crucial for muscle development and strength improvement. I will link some sites below to further explain this.
